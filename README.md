# Weather Application

A command line app for fetching location and weather data, exploring the async nature of Node.

## How it works
Provide the location name and the app will fetch the weather data for that location.

### Callbacks app file:
Uses request library and callbacks to handle the functionality. Later refactored to promises.

### Promises app file:
Uses axios library and is build to work with the returned promises. As well as extra functionality over the callbacks app file.
